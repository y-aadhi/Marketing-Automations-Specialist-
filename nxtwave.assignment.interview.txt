Task 1: Design Omnichannel Lead Nurturing Workflow

Scenario Recap: NxtWave users sign up but often don’t complete their profile. You need to automate reminders across WhatsApp, SMS, and Email.

Steps to Complete:

Open diagrams.net
 and create a new flowchart.

Represent the workflow logic:

Flowchart Outline:

Start → Day 0 (Signup)
→ Send WhatsApp, SMS, Email (parallel)

Day 1 → Check profile completion

If complete → Exit workflow → Send congratulatory message

If incomplete → Continue to Reminder Loop

Reminder Loop (Day 1–3):

Send WhatsApp reminder

If delivered → Wait 24h → Recheck profile

If failed → Send SMS backup

Repeat 3 days

After Day 3 → Final Email Reminder → End workflow

Use proper shapes:

Ovals → Start/End

Rectangles → Actions

Diamonds → Decision points

Arrows → Workflow direction

Publish diagram as a public link:

File → Share → Link → Enable public access

Deliverable: Public link to flowchart.
